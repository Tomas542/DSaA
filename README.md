1. Merge sort
2. Quick sort
3. Selection sort
4. Bubble sort
5. Insertion sort
6. Shell sort
7. Heap sort
8. Bucket sort
9. Stalin sort
10. Bogo sort

### :mag_right: Search (only Python for now)

1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Binary search tree
4. Fibonacci search
5. Interpolation search
6. Bloom filter
